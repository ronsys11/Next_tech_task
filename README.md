How this machine works

1- The balls are initially filled in the loading bucket
2- Due to the tapering base of the bucket balls align with the centre hole
3- They are stopped from enting into the feeding tube using another dc motor which uses rotary to linear mechanism to block the balls.
4- The user can then start entering the speed with which they would want Motor 1 and motor 2 to rrun at run at, Once the motors are running they can on the switch which would let    the balls enter the feeding tube.
